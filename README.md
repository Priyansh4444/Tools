# Pronsh/Tools

These are really cool tools that I found on the internet which as a student I do not think I would have found without digging alot. So I made this list of resources/tools that I found useful and I hope you find them useful too.
(I might keep updating this and revisiting this for my own use so this is a very biased list).

## Database Providers

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Though highly discourage this one
- [Turso](https://turso.tech/) Though kinda unreliable supposedly with stories about dropping random tables I think
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) They use Vitess to scale which is powerful af, partially github and youtube are powered!! 30$ does T3 CHAt
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) Yes they have a database service too
- [SingleStore](https://www.singlestore.com/) really good as well (works w drizzle, id say next to planetscale)
- [Neon](https://neondb.tech/) PlanetScale is the best scalable for sql but the rest are kinda solid for db you wanna use

## LocalDB Sync ServerDB

This was inspired by theo, he mentions like a localdb is only good for realtime, collaboration and Local first, whihc NOT ALL APPS NEED TO BE!!! But if you are crazy about tech like me here u go :3
