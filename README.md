# Pronsh/Tools

These are really cool tools that I found on the internet which as a student I do not think I would have found without digging alot. So I made this list of resources/tools that I found useful and I hope you find them useful too.
(I might keep updating this and revisiting this for my own use so this is a very biased list).
